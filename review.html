His work was strongly influenced by the fact that unusually both his mother and wife were deaf. This led him to focus on the areas of elocution and speech, and eventually experimenting with hearing devices. The first U.S. patent for the telephone was awarded to him way back in 1876. He also had many other inventions in later life, including in aeronautics and optical telecommunications.",
